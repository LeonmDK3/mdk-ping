Pings can be placed on: Static locations (e.g., ground or environment). Dynamic entities, such as players, NPCs, animals, or wagons.

Dynamic Target Tracking:If a ping is placed on a moving entity, the ping will attach to the target and update its position in real-time as it moves.

Shared Visibility: Pings are visible to all players within a specific radius.

Automatic Duration and Cleanup: Pings have a default lifespan (10 seconds) and disappear automatically.
